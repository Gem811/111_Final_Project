The first test case “setUp” creates a test directory and test file inside it with text and attempts to create it.
The second test case “tearDown” cleans the test directory made above and removes it, checking to make sure it worked, and the path existed.
The third test case “test_directory_creation” checks if the directory contains a specific test file, maintaining that everything was zipped correctly.
The fourth test case “test_zip_file_creation” checks to see if a zip file was created even if nothing was input for name.
The fifth test case “test_zip_file_contents” checks that the zip file created contains the correct files before and after the zip file creation.
The sixth test case “test_custom_zip_filename” checks to see if the correct file name was made on the zip file.
The last test case “test_confirmation_message” checks to see if the confirmation message was printed correctly to the user.
